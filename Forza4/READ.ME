# Connect Four

This project is a browser-based Connect Four game inspired by the classic board interface.

## Main Features

- Human vs Computer gameplay.
- Player name input before starting.
- Three AI levels: `low`, `middle`, `high`.
- Classic 7x6 board with red/yellow discs.
- Win detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines.
- Draw detection when the board is full.
- Responsive layout that adapts to browser height.

## AI Difficulty

- `low`: random valid moves.
- `middle`: immediate win/block logic, then weighted random choices.
- `high`: immediate win/block, then Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning.

## Run

Open `index.html` in a modern browser.

## Files

- `index.html`: game UI + logic.
- `README.md`: full documentation.
- `READ.ME`: quick project overview.
